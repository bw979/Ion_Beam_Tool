# Ion_Beam_Tool

This tool searches for top NEEC candidates for experimentation at a specific RIB facility, using energy loss and charge state calculations

John: Write python scripts that calculate energy loss at the effective beam energy 

Ben: Improve the resonance strength calculations where relevant
